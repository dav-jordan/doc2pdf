# doc2pdf
I got annoyed converting a bunch of word docs to pdfs so I wrote a script to do it for me.

## Installation
Copy `doctopdf.vbs` to the following path
```
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo
```
## Usage
1. Highlight the word docs you want to convert to a pdf in file explorer
2. Right click and hover over `Send To`
3. Select doctopdf.vbs
